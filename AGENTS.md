## Purpose of this repository

`fitness-manager` is a Spring Boot backend for managing a gym: clients, trainers,
appointments/schedules, payments, and notifications. It is the foundation of a
Master's thesis (diplomski rad). There is currently no frontend (the
`Frontend/` folder is an empty placeholder).

**This exact state of the repository (tagged `baseline-v1`) is the fixed
starting point for a comparison study.** Two separate AI-upgrade sessions will
branch off from this tag independently: one driven by Claude Code, one by
Codex CLI. They must start from identical context. Concretely, that means:

- This file is read by **both** tools (Codex CLI reads `AGENTS.md` natively;
  `CLAUDE.md` in this repo is a symlink to this file so Claude Code picks up
  the same content). Do not fork the content between two files.
- Everything below must be tool-neutral. Do not add Claude Code-specific
  constructs (skills, subagents, `.claude/` settings, hooks) to convey
  architecture or conventions - Codex has no equivalent, and doing so would
  bias the comparison. Plain instructions in this file are the only channel
  that is fair to both tools.
- **Update this file whenever you discover something new about the
  architecture, make an architectural decision, or change a convention - in
  every session, not just this one. Don't wait to be asked.** Stale docs are
  worse than no docs for a comparison study where both sides read the same
  source of truth.

## Tech stack

- Java 21, Spring Boot 3.4.5, Maven (`Backend/demo/pom.xml`)
- PostgreSQL (JPA/Hibernate + Flyway migrations, `ddl-auto: none` - schema is
  migration-driven only)
- Redis (Spring Cache abstraction, `spring-boot-starter-data-redis`)
- Spring Security + a custom JWT/refresh-token layer (`io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt`)
- Hibernate Envers for entity audit history
- Spring Mail (Gmail SMTP) + Thymeleaf for HTML email templates
- WebSocket/STOMP for real-time notifications
- MapStruct for entity<->DTO mapping, Lombok, springdoc-openapi (Swagger UI)

## Running locally

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in `MAIL_USERNAME`, `MAIL_PASSWORD`
   (a Gmail **App Password**, not the account password), and `JWT_SECRET`
   (>= 32 characters - the app fails to start otherwise). Spring Boot does
   not load `.env` files itself; export these as real environment variables
   before starting the app (IDE run-configuration env vars, or
   `set -a; source .env; set +a` in bash / equivalent in PowerShell).
2. Start infrastructure: `docker compose -f Docker/docker-compose.yaml up -d`
   - Postgres on host port `8877` (mapped to container `5432`), db `fm`,
     user `fm_dbuser` / password `password`
   - Redis on `6379`, password `password` (enforced via `--requirepass`)
   - Postgres data persists in `Docker/postgres_data/` (git-ignored except
     `.gitkeep`) via a bind-mounted volume.
3. Run the app from `Backend/demo/`: `./mvnw spring-boot:run` (Windows:
   `mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run`). Default active profile is `dev`
   (`spring.profiles.active: dev` in `application.yaml`), which additionally
   loads `db/dev-data` Flyway migrations (seed trainer/client test accounts,
   see `V1.0009__insert_test_data.sql`).
4. App listens on port `8088`. Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8088/swagger-ui/index.html`.
   OpenAPI JSON: `http://localhost:8088/v3/api-docs`.

There is no containerized app service in `docker-compose.yaml` - only
Postgres and Redis. The Spring Boot app itself always runs locally
(IDE/`mvnw`) against those two containers.

## Domain model

All entities extend `model/common/BaseEntity` (`@MappedSuperclass`): `version`,
`createdAt`/`createdBy`, `updatedAt`/`updatedBy` via Spring Data JPA auditing.
Every entity is also `@Audited` (Hibernate Envers).

- **User** (`model/user/User.java`) - email, password (null until account
  activation), `isActivated`, `notificationPreference` (`EMAIL`/`PUSH`/`BOTH`),
  registration/reset keys with validity timestamps, `Set<UserRole>`.
- **UserRole** - join entity; `role` is one of `MANAGER` / `TRAINER` / `CLIENT`.
  A single `User` can hold multiple roles.
- **Trainer** - 1:1 with `User`; employment date, birth year, `EmploymentStatus`
  (`FULL_TIME` / `CONTRACT` / `FORMER_EMPLOYEE`).
- **Client** - 1:1 with `User`; owns `Payment`s, `ClientSessionTracking`s,
  `ClientAppointment`s.
- **Session** - a session *type* (`INDIVIDUAL` / `GROUP`) with `maxParticipants`.
  Seeded rows only (INDIVIDUAL/1, GROUP/3, GROUP/10) - not created via the API.
- **Appointment** - date/start/end time, belongs to a `Session` type, optionally
  a `Trainer` (nullable - can exist unassigned), and a set of `ClientAppointment`s.
- **ClientSessionTracking** - per (client, session type) remaining/reserved
  appointment counters, driven by `Payment`s.
- **GymSchedule** - opening/closing time per `DayOfWeek`.
- **TrainerSchedule** - a trainer's status (`WORKING`/`HOLIDAY`/`SICK_LEAVE`/
  `VACATION`) for a given date and time range.
- **Holiday** - a gym-wide non-working date.
- **Gym** (`model/gym/Gym.java`) - single-installation config (name, address,
  contact info, logo/brand color, timezone). Real table, not a code-level
  singleton, even though exactly one row is expected in practice - see
  "Upgrade: schema decisions" below.
- **Room** (`model/gym/Room.java`) - belongs to a `Gym`; name, `RoomType`,
  capacity, and rectangle geometry (`posX`/`posY`/`width`/`height`/
  `rotationDegrees`) for the 2D floor-plan editor/live view. `Appointment`
  optionally references a `Room` (nullable).
- **RoomCheckIn** (`model/gym/RoomCheckIn.java`) - a manual check-in/check-out
  event of a `Client` into a `Room`; `checkedOutAt == null` means currently
  inside. Occupancy computed from in-progress `Appointment`s does not use
  this table - see "Upgrade: schema decisions" below.
- **ClientProgressEntry** (`model/progress/ClientProgressEntry.java`) - a
  dated body-measurement snapshot for a `Client` (weight, body fat %, waist/
  chest/hip/thigh/arm circumference, notes).
- **ClientPersonalRecord** (`model/progress/ClientPersonalRecord.java`) - a
  `Client`'s best result for a free-text exercise name (value + `RecordUnit`
  + date).

## Auth flow (read this before touching security-adjacent code)

- Login (`UserServiceImpl.login(LoginUserRequest)`) verifies bcrypt password,
  issues an access token (15 min, `app.jwt.accessTokenExpiration`) and a
  refresh token (2h, `app.jwt.refreshTokenExpiration`), both HS256-signed with
  `app.jwt.secret` (`util/JwtUtil.java`).
- Refresh tokens are **stateless** - there is no server-side store/revocation
  list, and refreshing does not rotate the refresh token (the same one is
  echoed back). A leaked refresh token stays valid until its own natural
  expiry.
- **Actual route protection is implemented by two custom
  `HandlerInterceptor`s, not by Spring Security's filter chain**:
  - `interceptor/JwtInterceptor` (order 1) - validates the `Authorization:
    Bearer <token>` signature, 401s if missing/invalid.
  - `interceptor/RoleInterceptor` (order 2) - reads the `@RoleRequired`
    annotation on the handler method and checks the JWT's `roles` claim,
    403s if none match. **A handler with no `@RoleRequired` is reachable by
    any authenticated user regardless of role** (e.g. `CalendarController`).
  - Both are registered in `config/web/WebConfig` with an identical
    exclude-list (register/login/swagger). Note that `forgot-password` and
    `reset-password` are *not* in that exclude list, which looks like a bug
    (a user who forgot their password by definition has no valid JWT to
    present) - flagged here rather than silently fixed, since fixing it
    changes runtime auth behavior and this session is hygiene-only.
- `SecurityConfig`'s `SecurityFilterChain` permits `/api/**` (and
  swagger/websocket paths) via `authorizeHttpRequests(...).permitAll()` and
  otherwise requires authentication via its own `oauth2ResourceServer` JWT
  decoder. Because the app's actual `/api/**` routes are already covered by
  that `permitAll`, Spring Security is **not** the layer doing authorization
  for the REST API today - the interceptors above are. Spring Security's
  `anyRequest().authenticated()` still matters as a defense-in-depth fallback
  for any path that is *not* under the permitted prefixes. Do not assume
  `@PreAuthorize`/`hasRole` do anything here - they are not used; role checks
  are exclusively via `@RoleRequired` + `RoleInterceptor`.
- CORS is configured in `config/web/CorsConfig` (a `CorsConfigurationSource`
  bean wired into `SecurityConfig` via `.cors(...)`), driven by
  `app.cors.allowed-origins` in `application.yaml` (defaults to
  `http://localhost:5173` for local frontend dev). **Change this to the real
  frontend domain in production - never `*`, since credentials are allowed.**

## Notifications

- Email (`service/impl/notification/email/`): activation and password-reset
  emails use Thymeleaf templates; appointment-reminder and trainer-schedule
  emails are built as inline strings (inconsistent with the templated ones,
  not yet unified).
- WebSocket/STOMP (`config/web/WebSocketConfig`, endpoint `/ws`, simple broker
  on `/topic`): `NotificationServiceImpl` pushes to per-user topics and
  additionally sends email based on `User.notificationPreference`.
- `NotificationScheduler` (`@Scheduled`): daily trainer/client appointment
  digests at 20:00, and an hourly sweep for appointments starting within the
  next hour.
- `websocket/StompWebSocketClient` is a manual `public static void main` test
  harness left in `src/main/java` (not part of runtime wiring, not test code)
  - known clutter, not removed in this session to keep the diff hygiene-only
  and avoid touching anything outside the explicitly scoped cleanup items.

## Audit (Hibernate Envers)

Every entity is `@Audited`. Audit tables (`*_aud`, `revinfo`) are **hand-written
Flyway migrations**, not Envers-generated at runtime (`ddl-auto: none`).
**Adding or changing an `@Audited` entity's columns requires manually writing
the matching migration** - Envers will not create it for you, and nothing
will fail loudly if you forget; it will just silently not persist history for
the new column.

Known gap: `AuditorAwareImpl` reads the current user from
`SecurityContextHolder`, but nothing in the request pipeline populates the
`SecurityContext` (auth is interceptor-based, see above) - so `createdBy`/
`updatedBy` are always `null` in practice. Not fixed in this session (it's a
behavior change, not a pure hygiene fix); noted here so it isn't mistaken for
an intentional design choice.

## Caching

Redis via Spring Cache, one global `RedisCacheConfiguration` (10 min TTL,
JSON serialization) in `config/cache/RedisConfig`. Currently only
`TrainerServiceImpl` actually uses caching (`TRAINER_CACHE`); no other
service caches anything.

## Conventions

- Layered packages: `controller` (thin, `@RoleRequired`-gated) -> `service`
  interface + `service.impl` -> `repository` (Spring Data JPA) -> `model`
  (JPA entities). Config classes are grouped by concern under
  `config/{audit,cache,core,security,web}`.
- Every entity has a matching DTO (`dto/**`) and a MapStruct
  `@Mapper(componentModel = "spring")` interface (`mapper/**`).
- Write-side request/response objects live under `service/params/request/**`
  and `service/params/response/**`, separate from the read-side `dto/**` -
  this is a deliberate three-way split (persistence model / read DTO / write
  request-response), keep new endpoints consistent with it.
- Lombok `@Builder` on entities that are constructed programmatically in
  service code; plain constructors on the rarely-constructed ones.
- `@Slf4j` logging throughout; scheduler/notification logs use an
  emoji-prefixed style (`🔥`/`✅`/`❌`) as an established (if unusual)
  convention - match it in that area rather than "fixing" it to plain text.
- No global `@ControllerAdvice`/exception handler exists; unhandled service
  exceptions currently fall through to Spring Boot's default error response.
- **Do not edit existing Flyway migration files** (`db/migration/V1.00XX__*`)
  - their checksums are locked once applied. If schema changes are needed,
  add a new `V1.00XX__*.sql` file. Dev-only seed data lives in the separate
  `db/dev-data/` location, only loaded on the `dev` profile.

## Upgrade: schema decisions

Phase 1 of the upgrade (data layer only - Flyway migrations `V1.0011`-
`V1.0014`, entities, repositories, DTOs, MapStruct mappers; no services,
controllers, WebSocket, or LLM calls yet) added the tables behind three
planned features: the live gym floor plan, AI manager insights, and visual
client progress tracking. This section documents every non-obvious design
choice made and why, since it is intended as comparison material for the
thesis, not just an internal note.

- **Single-installation model, real tables anyway.** The product is deployed
  once per gym (no multi-tenant row-level isolation anywhere), so `Gym` is
  expected to have exactly one row. It is still a normal `@Entity`/table
  (not a `@ConfigurationProperties` bean or a hardcoded constant) so it goes
  through the same audit/versioning/DTO machinery as everything else and can
  be edited through a future settings endpoint without a schema change.
- **Room geometry: rectangle, not polygon.** `Room` stores `posX`/`posY`/
  `width`/`height`/`rotationDegrees` (all `double precision`) instead of an
  arbitrary polygon (point list / PostGIS geometry / GeoJSON column).
  Reasoning: (1) real gym floor plans are overwhelmingly rectangular rooms;
  (2) `react-konva` (the planned frontend canvas library) has first-class
  `Rect` support with rotation, so this maps directly to a shape prop, no
  polygon-fill/rendering logic needed; (3) it keeps validation and any future
  overlap/collision checks simple (axis-aligned rectangle math vs.
  point-in-polygon); (4) it avoids pulling in PostGIS or a JSON polygon
  column + a geometry library on both backend and frontend for a feature
  that doesn't need arbitrary shapes. If a future gym genuinely needs an
  L-shaped or curved room, the fix is additive: a separate
  `room_shape_point` table (ordered vertices per room) behind the same
  `Room.id`, without touching the rectangle columns non-polygon rooms keep
  using.
- **Appointment-Room link is optional (nullable FK).** Mirrors the existing
  nullable `Appointment.trainer` - an appointment can be unassigned to a
  room. This also matters for backward compatibility: all appointments
  created before this phase have no room, and nothing forces one to be
  chosen going forward until a later phase adds that validation at the
  service layer.
- **Explicit `RoomCheckIn` entity, not derived-only occupancy.** Two
  occupancy signals are planned per the vision: (1) computed occupancy from
  appointments currently in progress in a room (derived at query time from
  `Appointment`/`ClientAppointment` - no new entity needed, since that data
  already exists), and (2) optional manual check-in. For (2), a real entity
  was added (`RoomCheckIn`, `checkedInAt`/`checkedOutAt`) instead of e.g. a
  single "current occupants" join table, specifically so check-in *history*
  survives past checkout (attendance patterns/analytics for the AI-insights
  feature) rather than only ever reflecting the current instant. A row with
  `checkedOutAt IS NULL` is the "currently inside" signal; both partial
  indexes (`idx_room_check_in_open`, `idx_room_check_in_client_open`) are
  built specifically for that `WHERE checked_out_at IS NULL` query shape.
- **Body measurements: fixed columns, not JSON/EAV.** `ClientProgressEntry`
  has explicit nullable columns (`weightKg`, `bodyFatPercent`, `waistCm`,
  `chestCm`, `hipCm`, `thighCm`, `armCm`) rather than a flexible JSONB/
  key-value map. Reasoning: (1) nothing else in this codebase uses a JSON
  column or an EAV pattern - staying consistent with existing conventions
  mattered more than maximal flexibility; (2) typed numeric columns are
  directly chartable by Recharts on the frontend without a JSON-parsing/
  pivoting step; (3) MapStruct mapping and query/sorting stay trivial. The
  trade-off, made deliberately: adding a new measurement type later (e.g.
  calf circumference) needs a new migration + column + DTO field, not just a
  new JSON key. Given the small, well-known set of measurements a trainer
  actually tracks, that trade-off favors simplicity here.
- **Exercise as free text, not a catalog entity.** `ClientPersonalRecord.
  exerciseName` is a plain `varchar`, not a foreign key into an `Exercise`
  catalog table. A catalog would enable things like standardized units per
  exercise or cross-client leaderboards, but neither is in scope for the
  three planned features, and building a catalog (entity, seed data, and
  eventually an admin UI to manage it) is a project of its own relative to
  what a diplomski-scale system needs. Free text keeps this phase's surface
  area small; if a catalog is ever justified, the migration path is
  additive - add an `Exercise` table and an optional `exercise_id` FK
  alongside the existing text column, backfill by name match, without a
  breaking change.
- **`RecordUnit` as a fixed enum (`KG`/`LB`/`REPS`/`SECONDS`/`MINUTES`/
  `METERS`/`KM`)**, matching the existing convention of Java enums + a DB
  `CHECK` constraint (see `SessionType`, `WorkStatus`, etc.) rather than a
  free-text unit string, so a strength record ("100 KG") and a cardio/
  endurance record ("5 KM" or "90 SECONDS") are both representable without
  drifting into ad-hoc unit strings.
- **Existing `AppointmentDTO`/`AppointmentMapper` intentionally left
  untouched.** `Appointment.room` was added to the entity (and its Flyway/
  Envers migrations), but the read-side DTO was not updated to expose it.
  This phase is data-layer-only by design ("entiteti/repozitorijumi mogu se
  koristiti, ali ništa nije povezano u API") - wiring the room into the
  existing appointment API is left to whichever future phase actually builds
  the room-aware appointment endpoints, so as not to speculatively shape an
  API contract before its consumer exists.
- **New audit tables follow the existing hand-written pattern exactly**
  (`V1.0014__create_gym_upgrade_audit_tables.sql`): only entity-declared
  columns are mirrored into `*_aud` (no `version`/`created_at`/etc., matching
  every existing `*_aud` table), and the pre-existing `appointment_aud` table
  got an `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN room_id` in the same migration, per the
  "Audit" section's existing warning that Envers won't create this for you.
- Verified end-to-end on this branch: `mvn compile` succeeds, and a full
  `docker compose up` + `mvnw spring-boot:run` against a **fresh** Postgres
  volume applies all 14 migrations cleanly (`V1.0001`-`V1.0014`) and the app
  starts normally on port 8088 with Envers registering all new `@Audited`
  entities without error.

## Known issues (intentionally not fixed in the baseline-hygiene session)

These were found during the repo-hygiene pass that produced `baseline-v1`.
They are documented here rather than fixed because fixing them changes
runtime behavior, and the goal of that session was a stable, unchanged-behavior
baseline - not new features or behavior changes. They are fair game for
either upgrade session to pick up:

- `forgot-password`/`reset-password` endpoints are not excluded from
  `JwtInterceptor`/`RoleInterceptor`, effectively making them unreachable
  without an existing valid JWT.
- `POST /api/user/login-refresh` is also not excluded from `JwtInterceptor`,
  so refreshing requires a currently-valid access token - unusual for a
  refresh endpoint, whose point is normally to work *after* expiry.
- Refresh tokens have no rotation and no server-side revocation.
- `AuditorAwareImpl` always returns empty (see Audit section above) -
  `createdBy`/`updatedBy` are effectively dead columns.
- `TrainerSchedule.date` is annotated `unique = true` at the entity level
  (`model/schedule/TrainerSchedule.java`), which would incorrectly allow only
  one trainer total to have a schedule row on any given date - it should
  almost certainly be a composite `(trainer_id, date)` constraint. No DB-level
  unique constraint actually exists in the migrations, so entity and schema
  disagree; this has had no observed effect yet but is worth fixing carefully
  (with a new migration) before relying on it.
- `UserController`'s `reset-password` mapping is missing a leading `/`
  (`"reset-password"` instead of `"/reset-password"`) - verify the resolved
  path before assuming it works as intended.
- `CalendarController.getScheduleForDay` has no `@RoleRequired`, so any
  authenticated user (any role) can call it.
- No global exception handler - error responses aren't a consistent JSON
  shape yet.
- `pom.xml` sets `maven.test.skip=true`; combined with there being effectively
  only one trivial `contextLoads()` test, there is no real test coverage and
  tests don't run by default even if written.
- `application.yaml` and `application-dev.yaml` duplicate almost every
  property instead of the dev file overriding only what differs (currently
  just `flyway.locations`) - keep both in sync manually until this is
  restructured.
- The Gmail account used for `MAIL_USERNAME` had its app password committed
  in git history (now moved to an env var, but the old value is still
  recoverable from history) - **the app password must be rotated in the
  Gmail account**, this repo change alone does not invalidate it.

## Session log

- 2026-08-03: Repo-hygiene baseline pass (`chore/repo-hygiene` -> `main`,
  tagged `baseline-v1`). Merged the already-diverged `feature/notification`
  work into `main` (it turned out `origin/main` already had it via a merged
  PR; only the local `main` ref was stale). Moved Gmail/JWT secrets to env
  vars (`.env.example`), added CORS config (`app.cors.allowed-origins`,
  default `http://localhost:5173`), removed the dead-code `"/**"` permitAll
  entry from `SecurityConfig` and documented the real (interceptor-based)
  authorization model above, enabled Postgres volume persistence in
  `docker-compose.yaml` and fixed Redis auth (`--requirepass`, since the
  official image ignores `REDIS_PASSWORD`), added root `.gitignore` and this
  file. No functional/behavioral changes beyond those explicitly listed here.
- 2026-08-04: Upgrade Phase 1, data layer only (`upgrade/claude-code` branch).
  Added `Gym`, `Room`, `RoomCheckIn`, `ClientProgressEntry`,
  `ClientPersonalRecord` entities + repositories + DTOs + MapStruct mappers,
  an optional `Appointment.room` link, and Flyway migrations `V1.0011`-
  `V1.0014` (new tables + matching Envers audit tables). No services,
  controllers, WebSocket wiring, or LLM calls added - see "Upgrade: schema
  decisions" above for every design choice and its rationale. Verified with a
  full migration run against a fresh Postgres volume and a normal app
  startup; no existing files' behavior changed.
